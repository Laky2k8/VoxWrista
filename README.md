# VoxWrista

VoxWrista is a Minecraft clone for your wrist! More specifically smartwatches [running the Zepp OS platform](https://gadgetbridge.org/basics/topics/zeppos/).

Have you ever wanted to play Minecraft on your smartwatch? ...No? Well now you can anyway!
Inspired by TheScienceElf's Minecraft for the TI-84 CE, this program gives you an isometric world of blocks that you can play around on! Right now only one block (grass) can be placed, but more blocks will come later down the line.

Features:
- Breaking and placing blocks
- Draggable world

More blocks (and maybe world saving?) coming soon!

**NOTE: This app was developed for the Amazfit Bip 6. I did not test it for any other device, and while it should work for any square Zepp OS smartwatch, I cannot guarantee it will.**

Got this great tutorial from https://github.com/griffi-gh/zepp-fediclient!

Prerequisites:
- Make sure your device is supported</li>
- <a href="https://docs.zepp.com/docs/1.0/guides/tools/zepp-app/#developer-mode-opening-method">Activate the Developer Mode is in the Zepp app (click for guide)</a></li>

- Install <code>zeus</code> (<code>npm i @zeppos/zeus-cli -g</code>)</li>

<p>
  Warning: Make sure <code>DEPLOYMENT_TYPE</code> is set to <code>"real"</code> in configuration.js.<br>
  (Optional) Some options can only be changed at compile-time, check/modify <code>configuration.js</code> as needed
</p>



<h3>Using preview/QR-code:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Run <code>zeus preview</code> in the project directory
    <ul>
      <li>
        If prompted, select your device from the list
      </li>
      <li>
        This should build the application, upload it and generate a temporary QR code
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the Zepp App on your phone
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to "Profile" -> "My devices" -> (tap on your device) -> "Developer Mode"
  </li>
  <li>
    Switch to the "Mini Program" tab and tap the Plus (+) icon in the top-right corner
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the "Scan" option and scan the QR code generated by <code>zeus</code> (step 1)
    <ul>
      <li>If you're unable to scan the QR code using your camera, use the "Open G..." button (in the top-right corner, on the "Scan" screen) to select a screenshot of the code instead</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Using the bridge mode:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Run <code>zeus login</code> and follow the on-screen instructions.
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure to use the same Zepp account as in the Zepp app on your phone.</li>
      <li>If you accidentally used a wrong account, use <code>zeus logout</code> and try again</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the Zepp App on your phone
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to "Profile" -> "My devices" -> (tap on your device) -> "Developer Mode"
  </li>
  <li>
    Switch to the "Mini Program" tab and tap the Plus (+) icon in the top-right corner
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the "Bridge" option and wait for it to connect
  </li>
  <li>
    Run <code>zeus bridge</code> in the project directory<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Once it starts, type in the following commands:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>connect</code> (if prompted, select <code>app-Android</code>, wait for it to connect)
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>install</code> (this may take up to a couple of minutes)
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>exit</code> to exit the bridge mode
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow the steps 2-5 again to disable the bridge mode in the Zepp App.<br>
    This should disconnect the watch from the bridge server.<br>
    <i>(Alternatively, you can just wait a couple of hours, the app will disconnect bridge mode automatically)</i>
  </li>
</ol>
